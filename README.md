# StrangeWeek

*I'm a new comer in the filed of Cyberspace Security, and I wanna be a contributor to the SECURITY. The road is so long, but I believe...*

I create this Repository to Record my learning progress.

My current learning goals are listed below:

* **Exploitation(Kernel and Binary)** (Mainly by CTF practicing and read some analysis articles)

* **Fuzzing** (Mainly by reading books and papers)

* **Binary Analysis**

Except the above, I'll also learn some basic knowledges about computer, like networking, browsers, etc.

*Note: Because my English is not good, so in the detail content, I'll mainly record by Chinese.*
