# Week

*I'm a new comer in the filed of Cyberspace Security, and I wanna be a contributor to the SECURITY. The road is so long, but I believe...*

I create this Repository to Record my WEEKLY learning progress, since September 22, 2019.

My current learning goals are listed below:

* **Binary Exploiting** (Mainly by CTF practicing and read some analysis articles)

* **Fuzzing** (Mainly by reading books and papers)

* The basic security of **Web Application** (Mainly by reading books)

* **Operating System** (By class and some Experiment)

Except the above, I'll also learn some basic knowledges about computer, like networking, browsers, etc.

So, this is the first week I decide to do this, the following link is what I have learned in this week.
